====================

Let your Kinect dodge those pesky lightning bolts on the Thunder Plains of Spira (Final Fantasy X).

Major snag hit! I was manually able to do the 200 bolt dodge challenge on my Vita, but seem to be unable to dodge a lightning bolt myself on the PS3 version. I even tried with a composite cable (to reduce lag) on a HDTV, but still have no luck. If I can't dodge it myself, I don't expect a computer to be able to. :(

Until I get a CRT television, this project is on hold.
